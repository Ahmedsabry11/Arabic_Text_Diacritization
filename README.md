# Arabic Text Diacritization üìùüá∏üá¶

This project focuses on **automatically adding diacritics (tashkeel)** to Arabic text. Given an undiacritized Arabic sentence, the model outputs the same sentence with appropriate diacritics applied **after each character**.

---

## üîç Project Overview

Diacritics in Arabic are crucial for proper pronunciation, disambiguation, and meaning. However, most Arabic texts omit them, creating challenges in language understanding tasks. This project aims to bridge that gap by building a deep learning model capable of restoring diacritics automatically.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- Takes Arabic sentences as input and predicts diacritics character-by-character.
- Supports character-level modeling for high precision in diacritic placement.
- Multiple deep learning architectures implemented and compared:
  - ‚úÖ RNN
  - ‚úÖ LSTM
  - ‚úÖ CBHG (Convolutional Bank + Highway + GRU)
- Preprocessing pipeline to clean, filter, and extract training labels from raw Arabic text.

---

## üß† Models Used

- **RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks)**: Baseline sequential model.
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**: Handles long-term dependencies better.
- **CBHG**: Combines convolutional, highway, and GRU layers to extract richer features and context.
